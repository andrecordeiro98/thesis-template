% Add entry in the table of contents as section
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\acknowledgments}

As a point of orthography, ``Acknowledgments'' is the American spelling, and ``Acknowledgements'' the other spelling. You can change the \verb|\acknowledgments| command in \texttt{thesis\_preamble.tex}.

This template is based on the one built by Diogo Ribeiro and Pedro Cosme. Andr√© Cordeiro later fixed some glitches with the formatting.
